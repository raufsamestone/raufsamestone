You may want to run campaigns that serve different landing pages to your users, especially in **B2C** mailing campaigns.

For this, instead of creating separate landing pages for each of your campaigns, you can develop more effective automation and marketing techniques using modern web technologies like [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/).

Assuming that the user clicks on our **UTM** campaigns, we will show a different landing page depending on the cookie status, without changing the page.

![Remarketing with cookies](https://res.cloudinary.com/raufsamestone/image/upload/v1642353975/blog-contents/remarketing-cookie/pg5hxxbpqsvmhncor0ub.png)

Let's see what we're going:

- Creating a new app with NextJs.
- Building [middleware](https://nextjs.org/docs/middleware) for rewrite functions.
- Create and set cookie status for UTM campaign values.

Create a new web app using. [More details here.](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app/setup)

```jsx
npx create-next-app
```

Create a new typescript file called **\_middleware.ts** on **/pages**.

Import objects from [Next Server](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/server) for Middleware API.

```jsx
import { NextResponse } from "next/server";
import type { NextFetchEvent, NextRequest } from "next/server";
```

Add a new function for rewriting. Basically, the task of this function is to fetch the userâ€™s cookie status, and rewrite them to the campaign page without leaving it on the same page path.

```jsx
//pages/_middleware.ts

const PUBLIC_FILE = /\.(.*)$/;

export async function middleware(req: NextRequest, ev: NextFetchEvent) {
  let response = NextResponse.next();

  if (PUBLIC_FILE.test(req.nextUrl.pathname)) {
    return response;
  }

  if (req.nextUrl.pathname === "/") {
    switch (true) {
      case Boolean(req.cookies["remarketing"] === "true"):
        response = NextResponse.rewrite("/marketing-page");
        break;
      default:
        response = NextResponse.next();
    }
    return response;
  }
  return response;
}
```

Create a new marketing page called **/marketing-page**, you can duplicate the index page for now.

This page will use for our main redirected campaign page and changing cookie status to false.

For that, we use [react-cookie.](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-cookie)

```jsx
//pages/marketing-page.js

const [cookie, setCookie] = useCookies();

const setRemarketingCookie = async () => {
  try {
    setCookie("remarketing", "false");
  } catch (err) {
    console.log(err);
  }
};
```

And we will run this function for when the user wants to cancel campaign and return to the home page.

```jsx
//pages/marketing-page.js

<div className={styles.grid} onClick={setRemarketingCookie}>
  <Link href="/">
    <a href="/" className={styles.card}>
      <h2>Back to main page &rarr;</h2>
      <p>I don't want it!</p>
    </a>
  </Link>
</div>
```

Let's refactor our original homepage. We use **useRouter to** check the current URL and, extracting UTM campaign values like Campaign, Medium. etc.

```jsx
//pages/index.js

const [cookie, setCookie] = useCookies();
const router = useRouter();

const cookieName = "remarketing";
const utmCampaign = "lead_generation";
const utmMedium = "email";

const matchCampaign =
  router.query.utm_campaign === utmCampaign &&
  router.query.utm_medium === utmMedium;

useEffect(() => {
  if (matchCampaign) {
    setCookie(cookieName, "true");
  }
});
```

Congratulations! ðŸŽ‰

Now, the users when clicking any UTM campaign, our cookie and marketing page will change.

Also, you can send to Google Analytics, this cookie value as a custom event for which users cancel your campaign.
