First of all, **it's not the recommended** way to writing content and push to your repository with mobile devices.

Maybe it just works if you cannot access your computer. Or maybe you can use this method when you cannot access your computer for your content that needs to be corrected very urgently.

You can use it on vacation or travel but you should enjoy your holiday and rest while on vacation. üèù

Let's assume that this case is a **JAMstack** project and you use the **markdown** as a content database.


## Markdown Editors üìù

It will give you an advantage to write your contents using a markdown editor with preview feature.

## Generating URL

You have to generate SEO-friendly clean URLs for file names or file paths to slugs without CMS, as manually.

You can try a URL tools or case generators. Especially kebab case!

### What is Kebab Case?
In kebab case, all letters are written in lower case and the words are separated by a hyphen or minus sign. "Kebab Case" becomes "kebab-case".

## Deploy

Of course, it is very difficult to access your git repository from mobile devices. Instead, you can try deploy methods using the APIs of the markdown editors above.

But the best method is to open your git repository in your mobile browser and create a new branch. 

Upload your content file and merge it.

## What about current Headless CMSs?

There are of course content tools in many CMSs. However, the rich text editor or markdown editors in these CMS, do not work very well on mobile devices, as compatible as the stable apps above. Also not at the editorial level.

And yes, this post is written with a mobile device. üòÄ
